<!-- 'lang' is the language attribute that defines what language we are using, with 'en' being english. It is required to have it included. -->
<!-- the metadata refers to data about the html document being used for a website and is defined in the head tag. It's best to have it in the document. -->
<!-- as with css, we use link to call an external css file -->
<!-- the 'header' tag in the body is used for titles and logos at the top of the page -->
<!-- the 'nav' tag, which appears at the top, is used for providing links to various other webpages -->
<!-- the 'section' tag is where the main content of the website is placed -->
<!-- the 'aside' tag provides content similar to or apart from the content in the section tag and is placed using css -->
<!-- the 'footer' tag is for providing company info, copyright, etc., which is at the bottom of the website -->
<!-- the 'article' tag consists of self-contained content, which includes its own personal header, footer, paragraphs, etc. It's useful for blogs, news articles, forum posts, etc. -->
<!-- the 'hgroup' tag is used for containing several different titles in the header -->
<!-- labelling each main element in the body using ids makes it easier to style in the external css stylesheet -->
